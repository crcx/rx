This is my personal, experimental branch of RetroForth.

Architecture

The VM is defined in retro.c. This implements the instruction
set, I/O devices (keyboard, screen, files, rng, and a few Unix
environment items), and embeds a copy of the minimal image.
Higher level code (retro.forth, devices.retro, etc) are appended
to the binary. This code will be compiled when the VM is run.
