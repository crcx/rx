---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+----

Files starting with t, are text documents.
Files starting wiht a, are archives.
Files with no suffix are Forth programs.

Special Cases:

    Makefile
    rx.c
    retro.forth
    retro.muri
    devices.retro

These are used to build the VM (the `rx` binary)

---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+----

Starting:

    make
    ./rx re

You will then be in `re`, the line editor.

Once `re` is running, try entering:

    lt,using-re
    ,

For some helpful hints on interacting with it.
