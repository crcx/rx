I've decided to focus on the archive and unarchive tools. The
file format is very simple. I'll store the number of files, 
then a header with the name and length of each file. This will
be followed by the file data, then the header for the next file.

I refactored the `ar` tool and finished `un-ar`. I also decided
to add an `ar-info`, to get a list of files in an archive.

After a few small tweaks, my environment is now working in a
chroot environment.

A simple:

    doas chroot . ./rx re

When inside the `sys` directory, and I'm running an environment
entirely written in Forth.

This is not really usable yet. I need to write more tools to
manage files, decide on file naming conventions, and spend
considerable time using it before it'll be finished.

So that's the plan. I'll begin using this part time, with a
goal of gradually reducing my time on BSD, macOS, and Linux.
As I do this, I'll work on making my system better, and also
start on the hardware side.

Note to self: this is a /textual/ system. All files are plain
text, other than the VM (rx) binary. No graphical display or
pointing devices will be required to use.

Second note: simple keyboard input only. Avoid use of complex
key combinations in favor of simpler models with fewer finger
contortions.

Under macOS, I had to make a small tweak to the `strip-commentary`
tool before rx would run. But it's now working, though I need to
do more testing. This isn't a big priority; I'll be without a
Mac for a while.

I've decided to just use a single directory; the repository is
just a direct reflection of my working environment this way.

Some tooling plans:

    dir not matching <text>
    I need to add this

New tools:

    backup
    restore
    cls
    duplicate file
    get file info
    findstr
    ar-merge
    more
    rename

Todo:

    rename `listener` to `forth`

I've consolidated down to one directory.

I have added support for setting the filename via the `l` and
`w` commands in re. This is *much* nicer than having to enter
the name, then the command.
