This is used to generate a backup of the working directory
using the `ar` tool. This can be restored using `un-ar`, or
one can easily extract manually or by writing an un-ar of
their own.

Delete the prior `a,backup`.

~~~
'del_a,backup run-command
~~~

Reserve space for the file listing, and set the `buffer:` words
to operate on this.

~~~
:place [ , ] s:for-each ;

'FileList d:create
  'ar_a,backup_ place here buffer:set #65536 allot
~~~

Copy the file names to the FileList buffer. Exclude the `rx`
binary.

~~~
:merge [ buffer:add ] s:for-each #32 buffer:add ;
file-list [ dup 'rx s:eq? [ drop ] [ merge ] choose ] a:for-each
~~~

The trailing space will cause a problem, so remove it.

~~~
buffer:get drop
~~~

Then just run the assembled command line to create the new
backup.

~~~
&FileList run-command
~~~
