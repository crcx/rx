My user interface is perhaps a bit esoteric. The primary means
of interacting is `re`, a line editor. This lets me create and
edit files, and has some facilities for running external tools.

I can run tools written in Retro by entering a : followed by
the tool name and any paramaters it needs. For instance, to
list files, I can enter `:dir`. Or to find all text files,
`:dir matching t,`

The command line tools are loosely derived from DOS and Unix.
But they aren't intended to be identical. I'm writing this as
I use it, so the tools will reflect my needs over time.
