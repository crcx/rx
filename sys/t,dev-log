I've decided to focus on the archive and unarchive tools. The
file format is very simple. I'll store the number of files, 
then a header with the name and length of each file. This will
be followed by the file data, then the header for the next file.

I refactored the `ar` tool and finished `un-ar`. I also decided
to add an `ar-info`, to get a list of files in an archive.

After a few small tweaks, my environment is now working in a
chroot environment.

A simple:

    doas chroot . ./rx re

When inside the `sys` directory, and I'm running an environment
entirely written in Forth.

This is not really usable yet. I need to write more tools to
manage files, decide on file naming conventions, and spend
considerable time using it before it'll be finished.

So that's the plan. I'll begin using this part time, with a
goal of gradually reducing my time on BSD, macOS, and Linux.
As I do this, I'll work on making my system better, and also
start on the hardware side.
