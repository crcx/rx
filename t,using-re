You are interacting with `re`, the line editor that serves as
the user interface to the rx system.

This is a line oriented editor. You interact with it by typing
commands. A command is a ningle character, followed by any data
the command needs.

As an example, the `p` command displays a portion of the current
file. This is followed by either a line number, or a range of
lines as `first,last`. Try it by entering `p1`.
